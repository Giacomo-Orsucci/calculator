# calculator
Simple graphical Java calculator

Graphical Java program. The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing. 
I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 
Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 
If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!

The program is in Italian, I hope this is not a problem in usability.

Credits to Riccardo Pacini, my friend and school mate, to have collaborated with me in this project.

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
